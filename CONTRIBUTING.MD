# Contributing

If you wanna help, cool. Right now I'm focused on getting the functionality working. I'd really like it if someone took care of the CSS.

##  General Workflow
1.  Fork this repo to your local github.
2.  Manage your personal workflow as you like on your fork.
3.  Fully test any changes you made, ensuring there are no errors in the console, etc.
4.  Merge your changes into your master branch.
5.  Rebase your master branch from my master branch.
6.  Submit a pull request from your master branch.

### Commit and Pull Request Guidelines
This is a pretty simple project thus far, but it could get fairly large in the future as I add other tools.  So let's keep things neat.

* Write concise, clear commit messages.  Mention the specific changes you made.
* In your Pull Request, detail not only the files you worked in, but the functionality you added or changed.  Try to keep it under 100 characters.  If you need to go into detail, put a summary at the top and then add detail a couple lines down.
* Be patient.  I check github often, but not necessarily every day.

### Style Guidelines
*  I'm using ES6/7 syntax.  You don't need to be fancy with destructuring, but avoid 'var' and such.
